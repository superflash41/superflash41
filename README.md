I'm a Computer Engineering student at [Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/), interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. My research interests include neural-symbolic AI, theoretical foundations of AI, and computer vision.

Currently working as a Teaching Assistant for undergraduate Introduction to Programming (1INF01), Programming Techniques (INF144), and Operating Systems (1INF29) courses.
